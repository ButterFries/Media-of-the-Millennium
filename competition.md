Letterboxd - The social network for film lovers    
- https://letterboxd.com/     
- Letterboxd has basic features similar to what we desire in our app,  however we would like to expand on those features to create an even richer app and user experience by adding more social features and increasing the range of media to possibly include music, video games,TV series and more.      
- We aim to capture a larger audience by having a greater range of media and create a richer experience for existing targeted audiences.    
- The users in both cases are those interested in media, those who want to review what others think of some media title, and those who want to create a review of some media title.    
- Letterboxd has the capacity to create the same experience as we hope to create, however the scale of this expansion is much larger and likely harder to administrate which may be the reason why they choose to focus on film titles.
