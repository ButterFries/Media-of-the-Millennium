– How is your product different?     
– If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios,     
∗ Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?     
∗ Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?

Letterboxd - The social network for film lovers    
- https://letterboxd.com/     
- Letterboxd has basic features similar to what we desire in our app,  however we would like to expand on those features to create an even richer app and user experience by adding more social features and increasing the range of media to possibly include music, video games,TV series and more.      
- We aim to capture a larger audience by having a greater range of media and create a richer experience for existing targeted audiences.    
- The users in both cases are those interested in media, those who want to review what others think of some media title, and those who want to create a review of some media title.    
- Letterboxd has the capacity to create the same experience as we hope to create, however the scale of this expansion is much larger and likely harder to administrate which may be the reason why they choose to focus on film titles.

Common Sense Media - Source of entertainment and technology reviews
- https://www.commonsensemedia.org/
- Common Sense Media also has some features that we would like to include in our app, the main being an in depth review with ratings of specific categories for a piece of media such as: positive messages, language, violence, etc. This is geared towards adults who are looking out for what their child is watching as well as what they may want to watch with their family. We would like to expand upon this idea so that parents may check reviews for not only movies (as Common Sense does) but other media forms as well.
- Our product will include similar in depth category ratings but will not only be a place for parents but all people that enjoy media.
- The competitors made this product with a focus on family (usually parents watching out for their children) and so it is designed more closely in that regard for parents. Our goal is to have that available but also a bigger community that can judge for themselves (not purely based on family values).
- In this way the users include parents and everyday media consumers.
- The competitors probably did not consider this focus because it is a much broader concept then what they originally had in mind, it would require more resources and money (they are a nonprofit so this would be much tougher to accomplish).
