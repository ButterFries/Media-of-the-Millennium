Done.md
•The whole team need to agree as to what ”done” means before each story is broken down into tasks.
•We have standard and additional definitions of done.
•Note the definition of done applies to all user stories

===========================================================================
===========================================================================


A task is considered done when it functions as expected as indicated in the requirements found in the description given by the user story.If a feature does not provide the functionality as specified by the user story, then it is not done.

Adding more functionality than specified within the user story that does not conflict with other user stories and if there is sufficient time to implement those additional functionalities is allowed, but this functionality must be specified and entered into the backlog where it can be assessed during the next sprint.

Should we later find that we expect more functionality out of the task that has not been finished, then we must either add the specifications for the new found functionality to the existing user story then push that user story back into the backlog for reassessment, or we must create a new user story.

Should we later find that we expect more functionality out of the task that has been finished, then we should create a new user story.
