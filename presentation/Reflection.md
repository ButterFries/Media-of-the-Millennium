PROJECT REFLECTION

GROUP - DEVELOPERS OF THE MILLENIUM

**Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.**

So some of the tools that really worked well for us was GitHub, Jira, Discord and SQLite.

- GitHub allowed us to collaborate and work on code together, using branches to work on specific aspects and merging them while highlighting any conflicts occur.
- Jira helped to organize and visualize the tasks, assigning each to an team member as we progressed.  Tasks were allocated to each sprint based on importance to development in terms of value and whether other tasks depended on that work to be complete.
- Discord made communication really easier.  It allowed us to both talk and text in a group and it also gave us the ability to share individual screens remotely in case anybody was stuck and wanted help.  This allowed us to solve problems asap.  We used Discord to hold brief meetings and discussions in our text and voice channels and documenting anything important in a separate channel or pinning the message.
- We used SQLite database to arrange our data which made retrieving and manipulating data simple without the need for complicated commands or setup.

Some conventions and techniques that worked well for us were that we

- used templates for coding the endpoints and database access methods making it easier to write new endpoints or DAO methods;
- organized functions in the database access class into sections to help us organize the data when more and more functions were being implemented, ultimately having over 1500 lines of code, but allowing us to find which range of lines was associated with what aspect of the database;
- documented the procedure for anything that needed to be setup so that everyone could replicate a procedure or setup easily.

Also we had a policy to be open to help and support when a member was having issues.  We would try to help each other solve issues as soon as possible in order to maximize productivity and prevent stagnant workflow.



**Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn&#39;t work well for your team. Explain why.**

The tool that didn&#39;t really work well for us was the Android Studio.  Every member throughout the project faced many glitches and bugs which at times took really long to solve.  A lot of members ended up wasting a lot of time fixing stuff that due to inexperience with the working environment and API.  An alternative that would have made implementing the frontend easier would be to use HTML and CSS.

In addition members had trouble with setting up the SSL certificates and necessary keystore to use HTTPS.  Because we had switched from HTTP to HTTPS early on, it created troubles that could have been avoided if we had done so later on.

We hadn&#39;t discussed nor designed the app backend nor the frontend in advance, creating issues as we progressed as we found we had to go back and make changes.



**If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?**

**In other words, describe an ideal process \_\_for your team\_\_, based on your experience working together.**

To prepare the backend design first and then work on the frontend.  We as a team suffered by implementing the UI/frontend first because as we worked on the backend and figured out what needed to be added we found that had to make a lot of changes to ui.  This could have been avoided if the backend was designed at the start.
