Objective: 
Make a Media Review Android App. The application allows for users who have created an account to write reviews, give ratings, favourite media, and mark media as read, watched, in-progress, or completed, for any media. Such media includes movies, music, TV shows, video games, books, etc. The app will allow non-logged in users to still view any content, but will not be able to interact such as commenting, rating, etc. without logging in or signing up. Users will also be able to interact with other users by leaving comments on reviews, comments on profiles, and sending direct messages to users. The app will contain a filter that will censor any banned words from reviews, comments, private messages, etc. Users will be able to block and report other users, and they will not be able to comment on any of the original user’s reviews, send messages, or interact with the user at all. 

The app will feature new, upcoming, and trending media on the home page, recommended/related media to one’s the user has seen, finished, etc., and will allow users to search for specific media or filter for tags. Users will be able to set their profile to public, allowing other users to see their reviews, comments, and associated media.

Users will be able to submit requests to add new media not already on the app, which will be vetted by an admin before approval.

The app aims to create a media review platform, allowing for further user interaction not usually seen on review apps.

Key Persona: 
Christina Mayler — a 19 year-old, second year student at UofT studying computer science. She loves listening to Lofi Hip Hop songs when she studies, and loves to share recommendations with friends. Christina loves to watch movies and often seems to have differing opinions from movie critics.

Alex Gretty — 27 year-old Alex is an up-and-coming indie music composer with 20,000 followers on Soundcloud. He often goes to a nearby provincial park for musical inspiration. In his free time, Alex loves to play rhythm games such as Rock Band, Osu, and Beat Saber.


Abigail Smith — 26 year-old Abigail runs a music review youtube channel and podcast with over 200,000 subscribers. She has a video series titled ‘Hidden Gems’ where she finds less popular songs on soundcloud or spotify that she enjoys, and talks about them and analyzes them in her video.

Key Scenario:
	Christina just found the app and wants to make an account to review one of her all-time favourite songs.
	
	Christina found a song she really enjoys and would like to write a review and rate it, however the song isn’t on the app.
	
	Abigail recently found the app and wants to filter songs that are highly rated but do not have a lot of reviews.
	
	Alex found one of his songs on the app and wants to see its ratings and reviews.
	
	Alex recently made a new song and wants it to appear on the app so users can add comments and rate it.
	
	Alex wants to mark Guitar Hero III as played and wants to favourite it so it appears on his profile.
	
	Christina watched a new movie and loved it. She wants to write a review, rate it 5 stars, and put it on her profile in her favourites section.

Key Principle: 
	Ease in searchability - Users should be able to highly refine their search. This can be done through the use of tags, min/max amount of views, min/max star rating, release date, and the producer, director, or the associated company.

	UI Organization - Users shouldn’t be bombarded with different options all at once, options should be hidden in navigation sliders and there should not be any redundant buttons.
