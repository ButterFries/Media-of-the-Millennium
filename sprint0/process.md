Our team collaborated through the use of discord. We created different channels to help organize our discussions and ideas. When an idea was proposed, there would be a back-and-forth about how large of a scope the idea would be, and if it was necessary. We made decisions based on the general opinion of the group once the back-and-forth conversation was complete. We defined user stories on a 1 - 5 scale for difficulty, value, cost-of-delay, priority,  and return-on-investment. The priority of user stories was defined based on how many other user stories are dependant on the previous one, and how much of a core component the user story is. The group usually had a similar score of the priority, and would at most take two rounds of voting. Only one in person meeting took place, where the core idea of the project was brainstormed and decided. All other ideas and discussions were done online in the group discord server. 
For the next phase, it will be important to meet up throughout the sprint to figure out how far along everyone is, and if there are any bottlenecks or challenges. We will need to figure out whos falling behind, and to equally split the workload, so everything is completed before the end of the sprint.
