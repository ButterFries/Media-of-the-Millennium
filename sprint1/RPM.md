The release planning meeting document RPM.md, document the Release Planning Meeting during your tutorial. This document has to clearly indicate the release goal, the scope of the project (at least in terms of epics/key features) and the participants.

Release Goal:

An android application that is a media review platform, allowing for further user interaction not usually seen on review apps.
The app will allow for users who have created an account to write reviews, give ratings, favourite media, and mark media as read, watched, in-progress, or completed, and create lists for any media. Such media includes movies, music, TV shows, video games, books. The app will allow non-logged in users to still view any content, but will not be able to interact such as commenting, rating, etc. without logging in or signing up.
Users with an account will be able to interact with other users by leaving comments on reviews, comments on profiles, and sending direct messages to users.
The app will feature new, upcoming, and trending media on the home page, recommended/related media to oneâ€™s the user has seen, finished, etc., and will allow users to search for specific media or filter for tags. Users will be able to set their profile to the public, allowing other users to see their reviews, comments, and associated media.
Users will be able to submit requests to add new media not already on the app, which will be vetted by an admin before approval.

Project Scope:

    -Ability for users to view application as guest
  
    -Ability for users to provide ratings for specific media titles

    -Ability for users to add media to their favorites/watchlist
  
    -Ability for users to see media reviews and leave their own review
