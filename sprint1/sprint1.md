Sprint Goal:

    Our goal was to have a general layout UI and the database for user accounts ready to be connected (next sprint)

Stories:

User Accounts

    As a user I would like to have a user account with a unique username or ID
    in order to have a personalized experience and a unique  identity on the app

Login Page

    As a user I would like my account to have its own page so that I can share 
    what genres or titles I like as well as show my activities so that I can 
    socialize with the community and express myself

All Media Type Pages
  
    As a user I would like to have a section for different media types such as 
    cinema, TV series, music, video games, novels  so that I can find titles that 
    may interest me regardless of the type

Summary/Review Pages

    As a user I would like to have a section to see the reviews, summary, 
    and ratings for each piece of media
    each media title to have a description or summary as well as info such as the 
    producers, cast, genre, and details  so that I can easily
    find relevant information without having to search for it elsewhere.
    (could be a template for admins to publish pages/views for media titles)

User Profile Page
  
    As a user I would like a User Profile section to see my information and 
    edit it. Such as e-mail address, age and username.

Team Capacity: 

Avg sprint story point: 5
7 members were available
4 hours a day (rough maximum)
Focus factor: 5 /(7*4) = 0.17
Able to work last 7 days of sprint

Team Capacity = 0.17 * 7 *(4*7) = 33.32

Decisions about User Stories:
  - Decided on user stories that could present a general skeleton of our app as well as the ones to setup the database (which we will connect next sprint)
  - Assigned stories and subtasks by who was more knowledgeable in that area

Task Breakdown:

User Accounts

    -Create user account authentication database
  
    -Storing login info into database
  
    -Admin accounts
  
    -Password security

Login Page

    -Registration view
  
    -Login view
  
    -Login as guest button
  
    -Signup/login button

Sections for different media types

    -App homepage view (for all media)
  
    -Homepage for all movies
  
    -Homepage for all music
  
    -Homepage for all TV-shows
  
    -Homepage for all video games
  
    -Homepage for all books

Media Title Pages

    -Add place for summary information
  
    -Add separate page for reviews
  
    -Add rating feature

User Profile Page

    -Edit Button
  
    -Display information
  
    -Button that sends to Profile Page

Other

    -Media title section for reviews and ratings
  
    -Media title database (basic)
  
    -Artist page
  
    -(BUG) onClick error had to fix base of app

Spikes:

    -Unsure how long it would take to learn android studio to implement most of these user stories
    -Understanding the database we would implement and need for server affected our 
    first user story (creating the database for user accounts)
