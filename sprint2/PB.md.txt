# Backlog PB.md
_• State your team&#39;s numerical series you do intend to use to estimate user stories (examples from tutorials)._  
_• Identify the most important user stories._  
_• How many user stories? We are not sure. Enough to give us (and you) a good sense of the scope of the project._  
_• As a guideline: a user story (usually) corresponds to a feature in your project._  
_• Any number between 3 and 20 might be appropriate._  
_• Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the criteria of satisfaction._  
_• Each user story should include a priority and a point estimate (using the numerical scale stated above)._  
_• Point estimate is a qualitative estimate, made by the team members. You will need to use planning poker as in tutorials._  
_• Additionally, all stories in PB.md, need be recorded on Jira._
