Unfinished tasks:

    -Update the view of different media types (scroll bar similar to netflix view)

    -Add to the database (certain categories, method in which we enumerate data, etc.)

    -Registration view

Good Practices:

    -Constant updates on microsoft teams and discord (our communication method)
    -Able to separate tasks and assign tasks properly so they did not conflict with one another

New Practices (To consider implementing):

    -Try to allocate some time everyday rather than more time later on in the sprint so that we could be possibly accomplishing more

Bad Practices:
    
    -Spending time only in the second week of the sprint rather than time over both weeks

Best Experience:
    
    -Seeing the layout all come together and having a working deliverable to present

Worst Experience:
   
    -Having to manage the assignment and project and other courses
