Sprint2.md

This document must clearly indicate the sprint goal, all stories for this sprint clearly identified, team capacity recorded, participants are recorded, decisions about user stories to be completed this sprint are clear, tasks breakdown is done.

Sprint Goal:

    Our goal was to create the server and database and connect it to our app. (As well as have basic security
    features present so it is not vulnerable to attacks).

Stories:

Top Rated Section

    As a user I would like a top rated media section so that I can see titles 
    that have been rated highly
    
New Media Section

    As a user I would like a new media section so that I can see what titles 
    have just been released

Login Security

    As an admin I would like security features that prevent input injections so 
    that the app is more secure from hack and crack attempts

Media Titles Genres and Tags
  
    As a user I would like different categories or tags for each media title so 
    that I can filter out titles that I may like or dislike based on the genre and such

Advertisements

    As an admin I would like to have ads so that the app can generate some advertisement revenue

Team Capacity: 

Avg sprint story point: 4
7 members were available
3 hours a day (rough maximum)
Focus factor: 4 /(7*3) = 0.19
Able to work about 7 days of sprint

Team Capacity = 0.19 * 7 *(4*7) = 37.24

Participants:

Eric Galego

William Li

Adrian Czarnecki

Decisions about User Stories:
  - Decided on user stories that could update the view as well as get the database and server going
  - Assigned stories and subtasks by who was more knowledgeable in that area (as well as if there
  was a specific interest to do said task)

Task Breakdown:

We had more big tasks this sprint, also user stories were more general and required
little to no sub tasks.

Server to handle requests from clients and communicate with the database

    -Server starter code
  
    -Create example http client
  
    -Create servlet to register an account and validate an account

Convert Connectivity from http to https

    -Https server
  
    -Https client
  
    -Remove password encryption from client side

User Stories

    -Media title genres and tags
    -Top rated media section
    -New media section
    -General input security/Login Security
    -Advertisement

Other

    -Remodel view of each Media section
    -Session key/cookie/token/id on successful login
    -Connect login and registration view to authentication database
    -Design and create Media title databases and java functions
    -Fix password validation process
    -Handlers to transfer images
    -Create reviews database and java functions
    -Functionality for posting a review


Spikes:

    -Unsure how long it would take to connect the database and server for future tasks
    (Knowledge of the server and database technologies)
    -Issues with security and what should be implemented (which form of security was best),
    also if we had the knowledge of that better security.
