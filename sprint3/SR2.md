Unfinished tasks:

    -Connecting java code for server and database to app (to see what is on the server)
    This is more in regards to images and reviews (works for login info)
    
    -Handlers to transfer images is untested

Good Practices:

    -Constant updates on microsoft teams and discord (our communication method)
    -Able to separate tasks and assign tasks properly so they did not conflict with one another

New Practices (To consider implementing):

    -Try to allocate some time everyday rather than more time later on in the sprint so that we
    could be possibly accomplishing more

Bad Practices:
    
    -Spending time on tasks was seperated to the beginning or end of sprint
    rather than a little bit every day (Somewhat understandable as it was a busier week
    with midterms and such)

Best Experience:
    
    -Seeing the login information from the app itself connect to the server

Worst Experience:
   
    -Many of us were busy with midterms/assignments this week and worked on the tasks early
    or later in the sprint but not much time was able to be spent in the middle
