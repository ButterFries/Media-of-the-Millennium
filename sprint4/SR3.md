Unfinished tasks:

    -Admin link 3rd party sites (May be left out due to time constraints)
    
    -Upcoming media section (May be left out due to time constraints)
    
    -Adjust app views to be relative to screen size 

Good Practices:

    -Constant updates on microsoft teams and discord (our communication method)
    -Help was provided when asked for it, if someone was struggling with a particular
    task

New Practices (To consider implementing):

    -Try to allocate some time everyday rather than more time later on in the sprint so that we
    could be possibly accomplishing more

Bad Practices:
    
    -Spending time on tasks was mostly pushed back to the end of sprint
    rather than a little bit every day

Best Experience:
    
    -Seeing the items (text and images) from the database displayed on the app

Worst Experience:
   
    -Lots of issues with image handling
