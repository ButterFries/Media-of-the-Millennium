communication response times (email, phone, messenger, text, . . . )
- Discord: Within 24h
- Messenger: Within 24h
- Email: Within 24h


standup/other agile meetings (meet where, face-to-face vs. online, who takes minutes, . . . )
- Meet on the UTM campus or in a discord call, meet up on campus before tutorial scrum meetings


meeting preparation (whether preparation is needed, what to prepare, . . . )
-If preparation is needed every member must have code, research, and concepts on hand to discuss and review with the team.
-When planning for the next sprint, each member must have sample code or concepts to discuss with the team.  



version control (what to/not to commit, content of log messages, . . . )
- Commit and push any finished deliverables to the current sprint cycle branch, with an associated message.
- At the end of the sprint cycle, the branch associated with the sprint cycle will be reviewed for errors by all members.
- After the work is reviewed for errors, the sprint branch will be merged with the master. Following the merge, a new branch will be made for the following sprint.


roles and division of work (how to divide work, who will decide who does what, . . . )
- To fairly and equally divide the work, the group will have a meeting within the discord group to ensure each member has a fair divide of work. Moreover, each user story will be given a complexity rating, which then will be evenly assigned to each member. This will be done to make sure that no single team member will be given an overly complex workload to avoid possible burnout and lack of quality. 


submitting sprint deliverables and software (when to submit, who will submit, who will review
the submission to make sure it is complete and correct, . . . )
- Any completed sprint deliverables will be pushed to their corresponding sprint branch. Furthermore, at the end of the sprint cycle, the sprint branch will be merged with the master.
- Whenever a sprint deliverable is completed, that member will pull the sprint branch and make sure the program works correctly. 
- If an error is found and is trivial to fix, the member will push a commit to the sprint branch to fix the error. If the error is not trivial, it will be discussed in a meeting and will be assigned to a member.


contingency planning (what if a team member drops out, what if a team member misses  meetings or does not complete agreed upon tasks on time, what if a team member is academically dishonest, . . . ) It is important not to let such situations continue. Ignoring the problem never solves it.
- If a team member is academically dishonest, the team will report it to the professor as soon as possible. 
- In the case of a team member dropping the course, the unfinished user stories assigned to that member will be split between the remaining members of the team.
- If a team member is unable to attend a meeting or misses a meeting, then the team will consider the substantial content the member was assigned to bring to the meeting and acquire that material from them as soon as possible via other communication methods.
- If work is late or unfinished then the team should review what has been completed and consider its priority in the following sprint.
- If a team member continuously fails to meet deadlines for the assigned sprint deliverables without a justified reason, then the member will be reported to the professor.
